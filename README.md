# 1. Introduction
Convert a Raspberry Pi into a HID proxy that relays Bluetooth keyboard and mouse input to USB. Minimal configuration. Zero hassle.

The issue with Bluetooth devices is that you usually can't use them to wake up sleeping devices, access the BIOS or OS select menu (GRUB). Some devices don't even have a (working) Bluetooth interface.  

Sounds familiar? Congratulations! **You just found the solution!**

# 2. Features
- Simple installation and highly automated setup 
- Supports multiple input devices (currently keyboard and mouse - more than one of each kind simultaneously)
- Auto-reconnect feature for input devices (power off, energy saving mode, out of range, etc.)
- Robust error handling and logging
- Installation as a systemd service
- Reliable concurrency using state-of-the-art [TaskGroups](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#task-groups)
- Clean and actively maintained code base

# 3. Requirements
- ([Single-board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_computer)) computer with Bluetooth support, e.g. Raspberry Pi 4B or Raspberry Pi Zero **_W_**
- Python 3.11 for using [TaskGroups](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#task-groups) (script to install from source [available](https://github.com/quaxalber/bluetooth_2_usb/blob/master/install_python_3.11.sh))
- Linux OS with systemd support, e.g. [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)

# 4. Installation
Follow these steps to install and configure the project:

## 4.1. Prerequisites 
1. Prepare your Raspberry Pi (e.g. using [Pi Imager](https://youtu.be/ntaXWS8Lk34)) and connect to WI-FI & enable SSH, if you intend to access the Pi remotely.
   
2. Connect to the Pi and update the packages:
   ```console
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

3. Pair and trust any Bluetooth devices you wish to relay, either via GUI or:
   ```console
   bluetoothctl
   scan on
   ```
   ... wait for your devices to show up and note their MAC addresses (you may also type the first characters and hit `TAB` for auto-completion in the following commands) ...
   ```console
   pair a1:b2:c3:d4:e5:f6
   trust a1:b2:c3:d4:e5:f6
   ```
   (replace `a1:b2:c3:d4:e5:f6` by your Bluetooth device's MAC)

## 4.2. Setup 
4. On the Pi, clone the repository:  
   ```console
   git clone https://github.com/quaxalber/bluetooth_2_usb.git
   ```
   
5. Navigate to the project folder:  
   ```console
   cd bluetooth_2_usb
   ```

6. Run the installation script as root:  
   ```console
   sudo bash install.sh
   ```

7. Restart the Pi (prompt at the end of `install.sh`)
   
8. Check which Linux input devices your Bluetooth devices are mapped to:
   
   8.1. Start an interactive Python session:
   ```console
   python3.11
   ```

   8.2. Copy & paste these commands (`Enter` twice):
   ```python
   import evdev
   devices = [evdev.InputDevice(path) for path in evdev.list_devices()]
   for device in devices:
       print(device.path, device.name, device.phys)
   ```

   8.3. Note the device paths of the devices you want to use:
   ```console
   /dev/input/event3 Moody Mouse a1:b2:c3:d4:e5:f6     <---
   /dev/input/event2 Moody Keyboard a1:b2:c3:d4:e5:f6  <---
   /dev/input/event1 vc4-hdmi-1 vc4-hdmi-1/input0
   /dev/input/event0 vc4-hdmi-0 vc4-hdmi-0/input0
   ```

9.  Specify the correct input devices in `bluetooth_2_usb.service`:
    ```console
    nano bluetooth_2_usb.service
    ```

     And change `event3` and `event2` according to **8.3.** 
   
     (`Ctrl + X` > `Y` > `Enter` to exit)

10. (*optional*) If you wish to test first, without actually sending anything to the target devices, append `-s` to the `ExecStart=` command to enable sandbox mode. To increase log verbosity add `-d`.
    
11. Reload and restart service:
    ```console
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo service bluetooth_2_usb restart
    ```

12. Verify that the service is running:
    ```console
    service bluetooth_2_usb status
    ```
    It should look something like this:
    ```console
    user@raspberrypi:~/bluetooth_2_usb $ service bluetooth_2_usb status

# 5. Usage
Connect the power USB port of your Pi (Micro-USB or USB-C) via cable with a USB port on your target device. You should hear the USB connection sound (depending on the target device) and be able to access your target device wirelessly using your Bluetooth keyboard or mouse. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It's essential to use the small power port instead of the bigger USB-A ports, since only the power port has the [OTG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_On-The-Go) feature required for [USB gadgets](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/usb/gadget.html). 

## 5.1. Command-line arguments
Currently you can provide the following CLI arguments:

```console
user@raspberrypi:~/bluetooth_2_usb $ python3.11 bluetooth_2_usb.py -h
usage: bluetooth_2_usb.py [-h] [--keyboards KEYBOARDS] [--mice MICE] [--sandbox] [--debug] [--log_to_file] [--log_path LOG_PATH] [--version]

Bluetooth to USB HID proxy. Reads incoming mouse and keyboard events (e.g., Bluetooth) and forwards them to USB using Linux's gadget mode.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --keyboards KEYBOARDS, -k KEYBOARDS
                        Comma-separated list of input device paths for keyboards to be registered and connected. Default is None. Example: --keyboards /dev/input/event2,/dev/input/event4
  --mice MICE, -m MICE  Comma-separated list of input device paths for mice to be registered and connected. Default is None. Example: --mice /dev/input/event3,/dev/input/event5
  --sandbox, -s         Only read input events but do not forward them to the output devices.
  --debug, -d           Enable debug mode. Increases log verbosity
  --log_to_file, -f     Add a handler that logs to file additionally to stdout.
  --log_path LOG_PATH, -p LOG_PATH
                        The path of the log file. Default is /var/log/bluetooth_2_usb/bluetooth_2_usb.log.
  --version, -v         Display the version number of this software.
```

## 5.2. Troubleshooting

### 5.2.1. The Pi keeps rebooting or crashes randomly
This is likely due to the limited power the Pi gets from the host's USB port. Try these steps:
- If available, connect your Pi to a USB 3 port on the host  / target device (usually blue). 
  
  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > *Do not use* the blue (or black) USB-A ports *of your Pi* to connect. **This won't work.** 
  > 
  > *Do use* the small USB power port. 
- Try to connect to the Pi via SSH instead of attaching a display directly and remove any unnecessary peripherals.
- Install a [lite version](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_lite_arm64/images/) of your OS on the Pi (without GUI)
- Get a [USB-C Data/Power Splitter](https://thepihut.com/products/usb-c-data-power-splitter) (or [Micro-USB](https://thepihut.com/products/micro-usb-data-power-splitter) respectively) and draw power from a sufficiently powerful power adaptor. This will ultimately resolve any power-related issues, and your Pi will no longer be dependent on the host's power supply. 
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > The Pi 4B requires 3A/15W for stable operation!

### 5.2.2. The installation was successful, but I don't see any output on the target device 
This could be due to a number of reasons. Try these steps:
- Verify that the service is running:
  ```console
  service bluetooth_2_usb status
  ```
- Verify that you specified the correct input devices in `bluetooth_2_usb.service` and that sandbox mode is off (that is no `--sandbox` or `-s` flag)
- Check the log files at `/var/log/bluetooth_2_usb/` for errors (logging to file requires the `-f` flag)
- You may also query the journal to inspect the service logs in real-time:
  ```console
  journalctl -u bluetooth_2_usb.service -n 20 -f
  ```
- Increase log verbosity by appending `-d` to the command in the line starting with `ExecStart=` in `bluetooth_2_usb.service`. 
- Reload and restart service:
  ```console
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  sudo service bluetooth_2_usb restart
  ```
- For easier degguging, you may also stop the service 
  ```console
  sudo service bluetooth_2_usb stop
  ```
  and run the script manually, modifying arguments as required, e.g.:
  ```console
  sudo python3.11 bluetooth_2_usb.py -k /dev/input/event2 -m /dev/input/event3 -d
  ```
- When you interact with your Bluetooth devices with `-d` set, you should see debug output in the logs such as:
  ```console
  user@raspberrypi:~/bluetooth_2_usb $ sudo python3.11 bluetooth_2_usb.py -k /dev/input/event2 -m /dev/input/event3 -d

### 5.2.3. I have a different issue 
Here's a few things you could try:
- Reload and restart service:
  ```console
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  sudo service bluetooth_2_usb restart
  ```
- Reboot Pi
  ```console
  sudo reboot 
  ```
- Re-connect the Pi to the host and check that the cable is in good shape 
- Try a different USB port on the host
- Try connecting to a different host 
- Double-check the [Installation instructions](#4-installation)
- For more help, open an [issue](https://github.com/quaxalber/bluetooth_2_usb/issues) in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/quaxalber/bluetooth_2_usb)

### 5.2.4. Everything is working, but can it help me with Bitcoin mining? 
Absolutely! [Here's how](https://bit.ly/42BTC). 

# 6. Bonus points 
After successfully setting up your Pi as a HID proxy for your Bluetooth devices, you may consider making [Raspberry OS read-only](https://learn.adafruit.com/read-only-raspberry-pi/overview). That helps preventing the SD card from wearing out and the file system from getting corrupted when powering off the Raspberry forcefully.
